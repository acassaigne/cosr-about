Title: Governance
Slug: governance
Template: page_project

Acknowleding the impact our search results may have on people's lives, our governance is based on [radical transparency](/values#transparency).

## Our structure

We are a nonprofit project. We will operate like a [501(c)(3) organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization) until we have the resources to formally incorporate as one.

## Board of trustees

The Board of trustees is our highest decision-making body and has the ultimate authority over all aspects of the organization.

As its name implies, maintaining public trust is the primary goal of the Board. To be considered for inclusion, trustees must:

 - Have publicly demonstrated a lasting dedication to the Open Web, in the spirit of our [core values](/values).
 - Adopt a strict disclosure policy and be undeniably able to cast personal interests aside.
 - Add diversity in ideas and background to the board.

The Board of trustees must have 7 to 15 members and seek to keep that number odd. Further details will be discussed before we create the Foundation.

## Core team

The core team reports to the Board and is in charge of the day-to-day operations. If the need arises, it may operate within a regular corporation wholly owned by the Foundation, like the [Mozilla Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation).

## Project leads

Common Search is divided in several [sub-projects](https://github.com/commonsearch) with leads reporting to the core team. Project leads should be experts in their fields and be able to foster an open and healthy contribution environment.
