Title: How to contribute
Slug: contributing
Template: page_contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Common Search! There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them.

## Developers

We have a [dedicated page for developers](/developer/get-started) where you will find instructions on how to get started, understand our technical architecture and fix your first issue!

You can also go straight to [GitHub](https://github.com/commonsearch) and look at the code :-)

## Designers

Our [UI Demo](https://uidemo.commonsearch.org/) is already online, go test it now!

We welcome all your feedback on how to improve it, both from a visual and a usability standpoint. You can report bugs or offer your opinion in our [cosr-front repository](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-front/issues)!

## Testers

Even if our search results are still at a very early stage, we welcome your feedback on our [UI Demo](https://uidemo.commonsearch.org/). Please use our [cosr-results repository](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-results/issues) repository to report issues!

## Others

Feel free to [reach out to us](/contact) if you can help in any other way!
