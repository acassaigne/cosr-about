## Our mission is to build and operate a nonprofit search engine for the Web.

Why?

The Web is now a critical resource for humanity, of which search engines are the **arbiters**. They decide which websites get traffic, which companies survive, which ideas spread.

The Web is currently in danger because the only arbiters available to us are all profit-seeking companies.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with profit-seeking. It has been a tremendous driver for innovation, and will continue to be. What is wrong is **not being able to choose an alternative**.

This is why we are building a new kind of search engine: open, transparent and independent.

Just like an arbiter should be.
