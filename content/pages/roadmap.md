Title: Current status & Roadmap
Slug: roadmap
Template: page_project


## Current status

We are just launching the project and [looking for contributors](/contributing). Not much can be shared with a larger audience yet.

**Service:** There is a [UI Demo](https://uidemo.commonsearch.org/) available (limited to homepages) so people can test the search interface.

**Code:** Everything is already available on [GitHub](https://github.com/commonsearch) in alpha state. This is where most of the work needs to happen for now.

**Governance:** We are looking for more advisors and reaching out to potential trustees.


## Roadmap

### Next milestone: Alpha stage

Alpha will be reached when we feel confident showing Common Search to a large number of potential contributors.

Most of the sub-projects should be set up with their initial structure, first project leaders and contributing guidelines.

The full service will start being operated during this stage, with some access restrictions to avoid disappointing the general public with low-quality results.

### Beta stage

Beta will focus on result quality, scaling up our infrastructure and establishing our Foundation.

Access to the service should be progressively open to a wider group of testers and users.

### Public release

At this point, we will launch the service publicly for everyone, with as much fanfare as possible :-)

But this will just be the beginning of the story! Many more years of continuous improvement will be needed until we become truly relevant and accomplish our [mission](/mission).
