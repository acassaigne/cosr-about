Title: Core values
Slug: values
Template: page_project

Our core values are the DNA of Common Search. They clearly state what we stand for, what makes us different and provide guidance when making hard decisions.

Starting with the most essential:

<div style="height:5px;"><a name="transparency"></a></div>
**Radical transparency.** Our search results must be explainable and reproducible. All our [code](https://github.com/commonsearch) is open source and results are generated only using [publicly available data](/data-sources). Transparency also extends to our governance, finances and day-to-day operations.

<div style="height:5px;"><a name="independence"></a></div>
**Independence.** No single person, company or special interest must be able to influence the order of our search results to their benefit. Our [board of trustees](/governance) is the watchdog of that independence.

<div style="height:5px;"><a name="service"></a></div>
**Public service.** We want to build and operate a free service targeted at a large, mainstream audience. Our impact and ultimate contribution to the Web grows with our size so we should make our service accessible and useful to as many users as we can.

<div style="height:5px;"><a name="pragmatism"></a></div>
**Pragmatism.** Recognizing the immensity of the task at hand, we should be willing to accept short-term compromises when necessary, as long as they don't go against the values above.

<div style="height:5px;"><a name="privacy"></a></div>
**Privacy.** Users should be [informed](/privacy) and in full control of the personal information they share with us and with any third parties.

<div style="height:5px;"><a name="focus"></a></div>
**Focus.** We are building a search engine. Not a browser, not an operating system, not an encyclopedia. Collaboration with other organizations sharing our core values should be encouraged instead of replicating their efforts.

<div style="height:5px;"><a name="frugalism"></a></div>
**Frugalism.** Lowering costs is easier than increasing revenue. Having a low burn rate reduces the influence of money and guarantees our long-term sustainability.

<div style="height:5px;"><a name="participation"></a></div>
**Participation.** [Contributing](/contributing) to Common Search should be easy for everyone, developer or otherwise. We must embrace and nurture an open community that will surely lead, in time, to a great search engine.
