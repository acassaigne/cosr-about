In the last decade, commercial search engines have spent billions of dollars in R&D and operating costs. We believe we can build a useful service with a fraction of that by making a few smart technological choices:

## Cacheability

Because we don't tailor search results for specific users, we can compute them once in a while and serve them cached to anybody else doing the same query later. This brings tremendous savings in computing time and allows us to have a much [smaller infrastructure](/developer/architecture).

Real-time or local search will need to be added at some point, but we will try to keep caching as much as we can.

## Open Source

We are committed to using exclusively open source software to run Common Search, so we will be able to stand on the shoulders of giants, use an incredible amount of existing code and encourage many new contributors.

We will choose languages, tools and frameworks not only based on their performance, but also on their simplicity and existing community.

## Partnerships

We think companies supporting the tools or services we use (or plan to use) have a strong incentive to help us in order to demonstrate the value of their products.

We will be happy to partner with any organization that can help us reduce our costs or improve the service, as long as they respect our [independence](/values#independence) and don't influence our search results.
