This page should get you started as a developer for [contributing](/contributing) to Common Search!

## Understand our project

First, you should have a look at the general [technical architecture](/developer/architecture) of the project. This will help you understand what role the [backend](/developer/backend) and [frontend](/developer/frontend) play.

All our code is open sourced at [github.com/commonsearch](https://github.com/commonsearch) and most of the collaboration takes place there. Everyone is expected to follow the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) in order to keep our community open and healthy.


## Your first contribution

There are several simple ways to start contributing:

 - [Report a bug](#report-bugs)
 - [Join the discussions](#join-discussions)
 - [Fix a first issue](#fix-issues)
 - [Join the team](#join-team)

## Report a bug

While testing our current [UI Demo](https://uidemo.commonsearch.org/) you should be able to find a few bugs (it's young!). Reporting them is a great first step.

First, locate the right repository for your issue:

- [cosr-front](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-front/issues) for frontend issues (layout, search behaviour, browser issues, ...)
- [cosr-results](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-results/issues) for issues related to the results themselves (relevance, title/description formatting, ...)

When in doubt, create the issue in [cosr-results](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-results/issues).

Before reporting the bug, make sure there isn't already an issue opened for that bug by looking at the open issues. When in doubt, **create the issue anyway** and a maintainer will help.

A great bug report should be precise, informative and courteous. Including direct links or screenshots of the issue is a big plus.

## Join the discussions

We add a `needs discussion` label to issues for which we are not yet sure of the right solution. We would love having your opinion on them:

- [needs discussion in cosr-front](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-front/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+discussion%22)
- [needs discussion in cosr-back](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-back/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+discussion%22)

## Fix a first issue

Fixing your first easy issue is a rewarding learning experience, and we are here to help!

All the issues on our sub-projects are tagged by difficulty, language and status. The label `help wanted` indicates that you are welcome to start investigating the issue immediately:

- [help wanted in cosr-front](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-front/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- [help wanted in cosr-back](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-back/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

If you are not sure yet on how to fix an issue, **don't worry**! Just post a comment in the issue saying that you are interested and a maintainer will help you. We really want to make it as easy as we can for newcomers and you will be welcomed with open arms.
