## Understand the project

Our backend has an [early documentation](https://about.commonsearch.org/developer/backend).

There is no specific documentation about the "About" website yet, but it should be easy to understand following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-about/blob/master/README.md)

## Bug Reports

You can browse our [About website](https://about.commonsearch.org/) to look for bugs. Reporting them is a great first step to contributing!

Before reporting the bug, make sure there isn't already an issue opened for that bug by looking at the open issues in [cosr-about](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-about/issues). When in doubt, **create the issue anyway** and a maintainer will help.

A great bug report should be precise, informative and courteous. Including direct links or screenshots of the issue is a big plus.


## Contributing to issues

All our [issues](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-about/issues) are tagged by difficulty, language and status. The label [help wanted](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-about/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) indicates that you are welcome to start investigating the issue immediately!

If you are not sure yet on how to fix an issue, **don't worry**! Just post a comment in the issue saying that you are interested and a maintainer will help you. We really want to make it as easy as we can for newcomers and you will be welcomed with open arms.

We also add a [needs discussion](https://github.com/commonsearch/cosr-about/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+discussion%22) label to issues for which we are not yet sure of the right solution. We would love having your opinion on them!


## Local install

You should look at our [README.md](README.md) to learn how to setup this repository on you local machine. Spoiler: it's easy!


## Pull Requests

When contributing code, you will open a pull request so that the maintainers can check that everything looks good before merging your code. GitHub has a good documentation on [how pull requests work](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Before pushing your changes, you should try to run the tests locally with `make test`. [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) will also automatically run them every time you push.

It's okay however to push failing tests in your branch if you need help from a maintainer!
